Deezer-API-data-exporter
========================

This small script exports your subscribed artists and your favourite tracks from Deezer. It is written in Python 3.4.

To start the script, insert your User-ID in the file "user_id" and your current Deezer-API-Key in the file "token". You can generate your temporary API-Key here: http://developers.deezer.com/api/explorer?url=user/me

Then, just run "deezer_api.py". Two semicolon-seperated CSV-Files named "artists.csv" and "tracks.csv" will be created, containing the respective data.

I'll document the code as soon as I have some time.
